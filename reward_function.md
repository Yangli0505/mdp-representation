# Representation of reward function

## Decision Tree

The representation of the reward function with decision trees is very similar to the representation of conditional probability distributions described above. Indeed, the semantics of the internal nodes and edges are the same. Only the values attached to the leaves of the tree are different: rather than probabilities, the leaves represent real numbers.
