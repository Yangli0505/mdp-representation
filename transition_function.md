# Representation of **transition function**

Transition functions can be represented with **Dynamic Bayesian Network(DBN)** and **Conditional Probability Table(CPT)**:
+ DBN: to represent the dependencies of the variables between time *t* and *t*+1 `under a specific action`
+ CPT: to represent the conditional probability distribution of one state variable at time *t*+1 given its parent variables at time *t* `under a specific action`

Figure below shows the transition functions represented with DBN and CPT with a specific action.
